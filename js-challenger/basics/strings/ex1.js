// After we have learnt how to create JavaScript strings, we will now connect 2 strings together. In the code below we use the Addition (+) operator to concatenate textOne and textTwo. The console.log() statement logs the resulting string. Currently, the result would be HelloWorld.
// Change the code below so that the value of res is Hello World

// const textOne = 'Hello'
// const textTwo = 'World'
// const combined = textOne + textTwo
// console.log(combined)

const textOne = 'Hello'
const textTwo = 'World'
const combined = textOne + ' ' + textTwo
console.log(combined)
