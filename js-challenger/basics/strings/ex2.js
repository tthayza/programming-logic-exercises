// Here, we have declared 3 variables textOne, textTwo, and textThree. An empty string is assigned to all of them.
// Do you see how in each case different symbols are used to create the string? All three of them are valid methods to create a JavaScript string.
// Fill in all 3 strings with some characters and run the code to see if the values get logged.

// const textOne = ''
// const textTwo = ''
// const textThree = ``
// console.log(textOne, textTwo, textThree)

const textOne = 'oi '
const textTwo = 'hello '
const textThree = `hi`
console.log(textOne, textTwo, textThree)
