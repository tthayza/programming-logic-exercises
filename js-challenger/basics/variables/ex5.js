// In this simple exercise we declare a variable called num and assign it a value of 5. Then we try to log the value of the variable using the console.log() method.
// But, the console.log() method contains a small mistake. If you try to run the code, you will see an error message.
// Fix the mistake and run the code again.

// const num = 5;
// console.log(Num);

const num = 5
console.log(num)
