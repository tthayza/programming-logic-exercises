// In this exercise we practice how to declare a new variable and how to assign it a number. The console.log() statement below attempts to log a variable named num.
// Declare a variable with this name and assign it a number of your choice. Run the code to see if the number is being logged.

// console.log('The value of num is: ' + num);

const num = 5
console.log('The value of num is: ' + num)
